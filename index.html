        <p>A Long-expected Party</p>
        <p>When Mr. Bilbo Baggins of Bag End announced that he would shortly be celebrating his eleventy-first birthday with a party of special magnificence, there was much talk and excitement in Hobbiton.</p>
        <p>Bilbo was very rich and very peculiar, and had been the wonder of the Shire for sixty years, ever
since his remarkable disappearance and unexpected return. The riches he had brought back from his
travels had now become a local legend, and it was popularly believed, whatever the old folk might
say, that the Hill at Bag End was full of tunnels stuffed with treasure. And if that was not enough
for fame, there was also his prolonged vigour to marvel at. Time wore on, but it seemed to have
little effect on Mr. Baggins. At ninety he was much the same as at fifty. At ninety-nine they began
to call him _well_-preserved, but _unchanged_ would have been nearer the mark. There were some
that shook their heads and thought this was too much of a good thing; it seemed unfair that anyone
should possess (apparently) perpetual youth as well as (reputedly) inexhaustible wealth.</p>
 <p>'It will have to be paid for,' they said. 'It isn't natural, and trouble will come of it!'</p>

        <p>Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,
 Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,
 Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die,
 One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne
 In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.
 One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,
 One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them
 In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.</p>
